            <h4>SharePoint Site Creator</h4>
            <p class="lead">
              During my work term at the University of Guelph as a SharePoint
              Site Creator within the School of Computer Science, I was
              responsible for designing and managing an internal SharePoint
              repository for teaching resources. This included researching
              institutional policies, consulting with faculty to determine their
              needs, and creating and posting relevant content on the SharePoint
              sites. Notably, I developed and implemented 7 unique SharePoint
              sites, all of which are currently in use by staff and students.
              The role required various skills, including experience with
              computer systems, file permissions, some web programming, and
              strong communication skills. While some of these skills were
              learned in class, others, particularly those related to SharePoint
              and web-based tools, were acquired and refined on the job.

              I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my Co-op Coordinator,
              Anne-Marie, for her invaluable support in refining my resume and
              cover letters. Her guidance and assistance have been instrumental
              in my professional development, and I truly appreciate her
              dedication and help throughout this process.

              I would also like to thank my direct supervisor, Judi McCuaig, for
              her exceptional guidance and support throughout my work term. She
              provided me with comprehensive training, enabling me to perform my
              duties to the best of my abilities. Judi's continuous support and
              detailed feedback were invaluable in my growth and improvement,
